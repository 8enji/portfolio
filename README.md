_being one of my first websites using react and next.js, this portfolio is not flawless. here are some of the known issues:_  
&nbsp; &nbsp; (1) the navigation links are unclickable while the scramble animation is active  
&nbsp; &nbsp; (2) there are some formatting issues on smaller and larger devices  
&nbsp; &nbsp; (3) non-uniform page sizes creating blank space at bottom of some pages
